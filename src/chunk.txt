General formatting notes (repeated sections):
** section headers are at left most indentation, all CAPS, 
no additional chars, one blank line between sections **

    - Additional: may include additional definitions/enums for properties
    within the command (i.e., OPTIONS and OBJECT for 'ip')

(REGULAR) EXPRESSIONS:
    - Purpose: outlines the syntax and semantics of the expressions/logic that
    are supported by the command
    - Starts with general explanations of the expression(s)/logic(s)/command(s) 
    -- major headers represent the subject of the expression(s)/logic(s)/command(s)
    (paragraph format) --> includes any syntax rules/guides (separate these?)
    - Explanations (or bullet lists) provide context to 
    expressions/operators/predicates above or below

    explain it (1-indent)
    - Additional: content directly below expressions/operators/predicates/commands 
    may include additional directives that are separated by a newline
    (no additional indent for these)
