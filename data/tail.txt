NAME
       tail - output the last part of files

SYNOPSIS
       tail [OPTION]... [FILE]...

DESCRIPTION
       Print the last 10 lines of each FILE to standard output.  With
       more than one FILE, precede each with a header giving the file
       name. With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.
       Mandatory arguments to long options are mandatory for short
       options too.

       -c, --bytes=[+]NUM
              output the last NUM bytes; or use -c +NUM to output
              starting with byte NUM of each file

       -f, --follow[={name|descriptor}]
              output appended data as the file grows; an absent option
              argument means 'descriptor'

       -F
              same as --follow=name --retry

       -n, --lines=[+]NUM
              output the last NUM lines, instead of the last 10; or use
              -n +NUM to skip NUM-1 lines at the start

       --max-unchanged-stats=N
              with --follow=name, reopen a FILE which has not changed
              size after N (default 5) iterations to see if it has been
              unlinked or renamed (this is the usual case of rotated log
              files); with inotify, this option is rarely useful

       --pid=PID
              with -f, terminate after process ID, PID dies; can be
              repeated to watch multiple processes

       -q, --quiet, --silent
              never output headers giving file names

       --retry
              keep trying to open a file if it is inaccessible

       -s, --sleep-interval=N
              with -f, sleep for approximately N seconds (default 1.0)
              between iterations; with inotify and --pid=P, check process
              P at least once every N seconds

       -v, --verbose
              always output headers giving file names

       -z, --zero-terminated
              line delimiter is NUL, not newline

       --help
              display this help and exit

       --version
              output version information and exit
